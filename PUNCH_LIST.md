## 3. Amazon Affiliate Products (Hardcoded - Need Verification)

Current hardcoded products with **assumed/placeholder** Amazon URLs:

| Product ID | Name | ASIN (Assumed) | Status |
|------------|------|----------------|--------|
| unofficial-guide-wdw | The Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World | 1628091282 | ⚠️ Verify ASIN |
| hidden-mickeys | Hidden Mickeys Field Guide | 0786855304 | ⚠️ Verify ASIN |
| disney-food-blog | DFB Guide to Disney World Dining | 1941500685 | ⚠️ Verify ASIN |
| park-backpack | Disney Parks Mini Backpack | B09MLZVQ1J | ⚠️ Verify ASIN |

## 4. In-App Instructions ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Added
- **Help button** (?) in play page header
- **Comprehensive help modal** explaining:
  - How to get started
  - What each square state means (with visual examples)
  - How to tap to cycle states
  - What counts as BINGO (with diagrams)
  - Tips for long-press, game codes, offline play, sharing

### Still Recommended (Optional)
1. **First-launch onboarding** - Auto-show help modal on first app open
2. **Tooltip overlays** - Point to specific UI elements

To implement first-launch detection, use Capacitor Preferences to store a flag:
```typescript
const { value } = await Preferences.get({ key: 'hasSeenOnboarding' });
if (!value) {
  this.showHelp.set(true);
  await Preferences.set({ key: 'hasSeenOnboarding', value: 'true' });
}
```

## 5. Landscape Support ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### What Was Added (in `src/styles.scss`)
- Responsive landscape media queries
- Reduced padding and margins in landscape
- Grid constrained to `50vh` width (centered)
- Footer hidden in landscape to maximize space
- Smaller badges and text
- Very small screens (iPhone SE): hides square names

### Testing Recommended
- iPhone SE (smallest screen)
- iPhone 15 Pro Max (largest)
- iPad in landscape
- Android tablets

**Note:** Most users hold phones portrait in parks, so portrait is primary focus.

## 6. Externalized Amazon ASIN Configuration ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Current Implementation
External JSON config at `public/data/affiliate-products.json`

```json
{
  "associatesTag": "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TAG",
  "enabled": true,
  "showInCardBanner": true,
  "bannerRotationSeconds": 60,
  "products": [
    {
      "asin": "REPLACE_ASIN",
      "name": "Product Name",
      "description": "Product description",
      "category": "book",
      "parks": ["mk", "epcot", "hs", "ak"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### What You Need To Do
1. **Get an Amazon Associates account** and get your tag
2. **Replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_TAG`** with your actual tag (e.g., `parkbingo-20`)
3. **Replace each `REPLACE_ASIN`** with real Amazon ASINs
4. **Set `enabled: false`** to disable all ads
5. **Set `showInCardBanner: false`** to disable only the in-card banner

### How It Works
- Config loads at app startup from the JSON file
- If tag is missing or set to placeholder, ads are disabled automatically
- If ASINs are placeholders, those products are filtered out
- Images are generated from Amazon's ad system URL pattern
- Products can be filtered by park (e.g., rain gear for Florida parks only)

---

## 7. In-Card Affiliate Banner ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### How It Works
- Appears **30 seconds after** entering play page (non-intrusive)
- Rotates to new product every **60 seconds** (configurable in JSON)
- Shows below the BINGO grid
- Has a close button to dismiss
- Marked as "Sponsored"

### Configuration
In `public/data/affiliate-products.json`:
- `showInCardBanner: true` - enables the banner
- `showInCardBanner: false` - disables just the banner (victory page ads still show)
- `bannerRotationSeconds: 60` - how often to rotate products
